# MultiTask Learning for Predicting AD Phenotypes
The first step is replicating an in-progress publication by a collaborator that focuses on using multitask deep learning to predict several Alzheimer's phenotypes from gene expression.

I initially wanted to adapt this method to use epigenetic data, but I have since moved on. I am leaving this here to have a record of code for building a neural network in Pytorch and some sample parameter tuning code with ax.
